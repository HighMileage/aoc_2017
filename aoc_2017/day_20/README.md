# Day 20

Part I was a lot of fun--I'm excited to see someone visualize this problem. I burned a lot of extra
cycles on part II because I hadn't carefully read that the velocity was updated in a new tick
before the position; now we know. I also expected there to be some collisions that happened on a
very long time scale. It seems like most collisions happened within the first few thousand ticks.
